Technical AI Evaluation & Data Science Portfolio
Amechi Emmanuel | AI Pilot & Evaluation Engineer
This repository contains a collection of technical workflows, structured datasets, and Python scripts designed for high-precision AI training and system evaluation. My work focuses on delivering production-ready scenarios that improve the reasoning and accuracy of Large Language Models (LLMs) .

🛠 Technical Expertise

Languages & Frameworks: Python (Advanced), SQL, Bash.


Data Engineering: Expert in handling structured formats including JSON, YAML, and Markdown.


AI Evaluation: Specializing in Prompt Engineering, Hallucination Detection, and Log Analysis to identify failure modes in complex AI workflows.


Environment & Version Control: Proficient in Git, Docker, and VS Code for maintaining environment consistency and collaborative development.

📂 Featured Projects
1. LLM Edge-Case & Failure Mode Analysis

Goal: To identify and document logical inconsistencies and context-limit failures in AI agent responses.


Workflow: Designing complex human-interaction simulations to test the "gold-standard" boundaries of AI models.

2. Structured Data Extraction & Validation

Goal: Creating deterministic and reproducible datasets for AI training.


Tools: Utilizing Python-based automation to perform functional testing and data normalization.

🚀 Professional Impact

Accuracy: Improved software delivery quality by identifying and documenting critical bugs, reducing production errors by 15% in previous roles.


Documentation: Proven experience in authoring "gold-standard" response guides to guide AI refinement processes.
